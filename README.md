Electromyography is a diagnostic procedure to know the muscle's health and the nerve cell that control them (motor neurons). EMG results can reveal nerve dysfunction, muscle dysfunction or problems with nerve-to-muscle signal transmission. EMG signals are also used as a control signal for prosthetic devices like prosthetic hands and limbs, etc, which are used in robotics also needle EMG is used in the diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases. The signals obtained from EMG are used as a gesture recognition. Kinesiological EMG are used in rehabilitation after recovery from an injury.
There are two components to an EMG test: the nerve conduction study and needle EMG. The nerve conduction study is the first part of the procedure. It involves placing small sensors called surface electrodes on the skin to assess the ability of the motor neurons to send electrical signals. The second part of the EMG procedure, known as needle EMG, also uses sensors to evaluate electrical signals. The sensors are called needle electrodes, and theyâ€™re directly inserted into muscle tissue to evaluate muscle activity when at rest and when contracted.
