Electromyography is a diagnostic procedure to know the muscle's health and the nerve cell that control them (motor neurons). EMG results can reveal nerve dysfunction, muscle dysfunction or problems with nerve-to-muscle signal transmission. EMG signals are also used as a control signal for prosthetic devices like prosthetic hands and limbs, etc, also needle EMG is used in the diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases. The signals obtained from EMG are used as a gesture recognition. Kinesiological EMG are used in rehabilition after recovery from an injury.
